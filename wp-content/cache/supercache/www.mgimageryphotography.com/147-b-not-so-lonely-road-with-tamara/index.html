		<p>The goal of my Lonely Road photo project has been to contrast models on empty, winding roads using motion, color and a peek of skin. But, what if your road of choice turns out to be occupied by the U.S. Army Reserves, weekend tourists, bicyclists, police, motorcyclists and even members of the State Government of California? Well&#8230;..some gals might be a little apprehensive, but&#8230;.my friend, Tamara, attacked this with abandon and LOVED the fact that she wasn&#8217;t alone! And, to convince you of just how much fun it can be to flash your boobs to the military&#8230;.um&#8230;..say &#8220;hello&#8221; to Tamara:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2982"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2982 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam1" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam1.jpg" width="665" height="475" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam1.jpg 950w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam1-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam1-419x300.jpg 419w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></a></p>
<p>LOL&#8230;.those guys totally knew what was going on and thus were pretty intrigued by my lovely friend! And, can you blame them? Jeez&#8230;if I was heading out on Reserve weekend with a bunch of guys this would be a perfect break in the action! So, hats off to the guys that protect us&#8230;.or, as Tamara decided&#8230;.tops off!! Woo Hoo.</p>
<p>So, this highway in the hills outside of San Diego was incredible scenic&#8230;which is why I&#8217;d picked it for our shoot. Now, the one problem I quickly identified was that I&#8217;d scouted the road on a weekday. But, come Saturday, things got a wee bit more occupied in this area as everyone was escaping the Southern California throngs and looking to reconnect with nature. Luckily, Tamara didn&#8217;t care at all about anyone seeing her&#8230;.as is clearly obvious in this next shot. She and I had pulled off the mountain road on a turn off to allow her to change into something &#8220;eye-catching&#8221;&#8230;.and she quickly drew the attention of a biker who&#8217;d stopped off as well to take a break:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2983"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2983 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam2" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2.jpg" width="480" height="720" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>Pretty hard to miss Tamara in this getup &#8230;.though the guy was doing a good job of not completely gawking at us. But, he clearly had seen her changing into her outfit and had to feel blessed to have chosen this route for his journey. Anyway, since Tamara is so damn confident and fearless, we decided to setup a trap for the guy thinking he&#8217;d continue heading up the mountain past us. So&#8230;.she ventured out into the middle of the road in hopes he&#8217;d pass right by&#8230;&#8230;.not wearing quite as much as in the shot above:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam2a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2984"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2984 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam2a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2a.jpg" width="480" height="720" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2a.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam2a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>She was totally ready to stand there, in the road, bare assed&#8230;.so that our biker buddy could fully check her ghetto booty out. But&#8230;.sadly, the guy actually turned around and went back the way he came! Hah&#8230;his loss, huh? Well&#8230;.this at least gives you an idea of just how fearless my model friend was for her NOT-SO-Lonely Road.</p>
<p>As you prepare to photograph someone on a winding and hectic highway, you need to have a good perspective on the traffic to know what cars are coming and from which direction they&#8217;ll be passing you. You need a couple seconds of time to stage something exciting&#8230;especially if it involves nudity! And, not everyone passing by will value a woman flashing her ass or baring her boobs in public, especially a lawman or school bus. So, with only moments to spare, I had to spot the vehicle from far off and then quickly determine whether our game was on or not! Luckily, the sky was crystal clear that day and our vision and lighting perfect for being able to see the passengers from afar. And, on a curvy mountain road, the speeds on vehicles coming around the curves was moderate&#8230;unless it was a motorcycle. But, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d guess, motorcylists love public NUDITY!</p>
<p>Are you ready for Tamara&#8217;s dog-style jump:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam3dog/" rel="attachment wp-att-2985"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2985 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam3dog" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam3dog.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam3dog.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam3dog-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Man&#8217;s best friends just became big fans of Tamara and it&#8217;s probably nice to finally see her from the front in her vivid attire, right? I love this shot because she&#8217;s clearly displaying how much fun she was having being semi-nude in front of all the cars whipping by! And, the folks passing us were enjoying her just as much. Imagine taking a scenic weekend drive on a gorgeous mountain road and being witness to this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam4/" rel="attachment wp-att-2986"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2986 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam4" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam4.jpg" width="480" height="720" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam4.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>From this angle the SUV passing by didn&#8217;t get to see too much of Tamara but they clearly knew we were up to some sort of antics. I mean&#8230;..LOL&#8230;.look at her socks and outfit! Many of the vehicles slowed a bit just to check her out and many of them were honking their horns the entire time! Hence, she&#8217;s literally laughing her ass off in at least half of the shots I took since she was drawing so much darned attention.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;speaking of attention&#8230;&#8230;amidst all of my Lonely Road shoots I&#8217;d never really had someone pass me by, turn around and come back once they saw what we were doing, and then actually introduce themselves and ask to be part of a photograph. But, I&#8217;d also never done one of my photoshoot on a busy CA mountain highway after running into the U. S. Army. So&#8230;&#8230;I guess there&#8217;s room for anything on the Lonely Road. Check this car out:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam5/" rel="attachment wp-att-2987"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2987 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam5" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5.jpg" width="520" height="728" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah&#8230;the dudes literally slowed to a crawl when they realized what was happening&#8230;..rolled down their windows, and totally photo-bombed Tamara&#8217;s Lonely Road flash! LOL&#8230;this is fabulous. Note that she&#8217;d even dropped her panties down and is flashing them her big, round ass! Well&#8230;we&#8217;d seen this car come around the bend and realized it was four adults, 3 guys and a gal. So, when Tamara spun, dropped her drawers and opened her coat to me&#8230;.things happened pretty fast. And, to see these folks totally joining in with our fun was AWESOME!! Well&#8230;as I alluded to up above, the fun didn&#8217;t end there. This car went about 100 feet farther down the road past us, hit it&#8217;s brakes, completely turned around and came back&#8230;.and then the driver jumped out and came over to introduce himself to us:</p>

<p>No frickin way! OMG&#8230;..a member of the CA government! Well&#8230;I guess if you choose to moon and flash anyone you might as well aim high, right? Well, it turned out that Jonathon (who&#8217;s last name I removed for obvious reasons&#8230;) was on a trip with his friends and just got a kick out of Tamara and what he saw us doing. So, he stopped by to thank us for our little show. Came to find out that he was soon to retire from the State of CA and was happy as shit to get in one of our photos. So, I let he and fearless Tamara come up with a plan for their &#8220;special&#8221; shot&#8230;&#8230;and&#8230;&#8230;.oh, yeah&#8230;.welcome to Jonathon&#8217;s world:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam5a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2988"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2988 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam5a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5a.jpg" width="520" height="728" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5a.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam5a-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a></p>
<p>Now&#8230;please realize that I didn&#8217;t encourage him to do this. Tamara is just fun as hell and she and Jonathon came up with this idea completely!  Very few women I know&#8230;let alone models..would be comfortable with such&#8230;.but you&#8217;ve never met a women like Tamara. Promise! I met her at Burning Man and know she&#8217;s one of a kind&#8230;..so, enjoy this shot for what it is. Spontaneous shock value and something absolutely hilarious. I mean, Jonathon was 65, days from his retirement, and Tamara gave him a present he&#8217;ll never forget. So, Jonathon&#8230;.if you&#8217;re reading this and remember that day&#8230;&#8230;YOU ROCK, man! And&#8230;of course Tamara does too&#8230;..</p>
<p>OK&#8230;.it&#8217;s hard to improve on something as wacky as that&#8230;but, our day on the not so lonely road had just begun. In fact, literally moments after Jonathon the boob grabber and his carload of laughing friends drove away, Tamara and I were greeted by the shrill honks of a parade of Vespa scooters out on their monthly Vespa Scooter excursion. And, what better way to thank them for their honks then with Tamara&#8217;s glorious bottom:</p>

<p>Woo Hoo, CA mountain roads.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.at this point she and I decided to relocate and find another turn on this scenic road where we could setup more of our jumps and poses. And, of course, it was also time for Tamara to change up her look.</p>
<p>So&#8230;next up for my lovely friend was her cute little yellow sweater top:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam6/" rel="attachment wp-att-2991"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam6" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>She&#8217;d chosen very striking colors for our shoot and they couldn&#8217;t have worked any better as we had such a crystal clear, blue sky for a backdrop! Tamara also used a nice, contrasting pair of undies to bring another visual element into this look&#8230;..though this first passerby didn&#8217;t even have time to fully appreciate what was happening:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam6a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2992"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2992 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam6a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6a.jpg" width="900" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6a.jpg 900w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6a-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6a-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>SLOW DOWN, man, and take in the scenery!!!</p>
<p>I mentioned how much most bikers love public nudity and naked chicks in general&#8230;but, that may not pertain to guys who are seeking high-speed thrills around mountain curves!? But, I wonder if he&#8217;s have preferred Tamara&#8217;s curves if he&#8217;d only known what was happening?!?!  Anyway, at our new vantage point we still had a bunch of cars flying past us as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam7/" rel="attachment wp-att-2995"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2995 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam7" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam7.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam7.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam7-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t Tamara&#8217;s facial expressions wonderful? She was no longer constantly laughing as the vehicles whipped past us&#8230;.and really did a killer job of showing a variety of emotions. In fact, if you&#8217;d not seen all the previous shots leading up to this, you might really think she&#8217;s shy and demure, right? Just an unlucky parasol owner who happened to have her shirt unbuttoned along a highway wearing lime green socks!?</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>But&#8230;.she really does look damn cute in this shot I think&#8230;.</p>
<p>How do you think this gorgeous model handled herself when we saw a solitary bicyclist approaching from behind us? Clearly&#8230;.we had a wee bit more time to stage this shot so I thought it might be a good idea to finally open her parasol for a picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam6pedal/" rel="attachment wp-att-2994"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2994 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam6pedal" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6pedal.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6pedal.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6pedal-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>This &#8220;committed&#8221; athlete was so focused on his bike ride that he didn&#8217;t even slow down to say &#8220;hi&#8221;!?!?! Well&#8230;&#8230;I give him credit for his discipline&#8230;.I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;cars continued to pass by and we even did have a policeman pass at one point. Luckily, as I said, we had a good view of the road approaching and were able to react accordingly. I&#8217;d keep Tamara pretty covered up along the side of the road and when we saw a car or person approaching&#8230;we&#8217;d make a quick call as to whether we should attempt a shot or not. We also parked in pull-offs and typically stood in rest areas&#8230;.so we weren&#8217;t quite as obvious as things might appear. We then could jump out into the road and get her a bit more exposed according to what we wanted to do. But, to celebrate how fun it is to pose on the Lonely Road without being questioned by the police or armed forces&#8230;&#8230;how &#8217;bout this shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam6fun/" rel="attachment wp-att-2993"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2993 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam6fun" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6fun.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6fun.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam6fun-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Ah, yes&#8230;&#8230;public nudity and flashing on the &#8220;not-so-lonely&#8221; road&#8230;..pretty damn invigorating!</p>
<p>Well&#8230;she and I were tiring and I still wanted to capture at least one shot of her gracefully jumping along the road with her cool parasol. So, we waited for a moment when no cars were actually approaching&#8230;..and, amazingly got this shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/147-b-not-so-lonely-road-with-tamara/blog-tam8-wonderful-day/" rel="attachment wp-att-2996"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2996 colorbox-2981" alt="blog tam8 wonderful day" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam8-wonderful-day.jpg" width="560" height="840" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam8-wonderful-day.jpg 700w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam8-wonderful-day-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog-tam8-wonderful-day-682x1024.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of my favorite motion shots I took during my entire Lonely Road project as I feel it shows the artistic side of Tamara&#8230;.quite different from the fun and wacky shots I&#8217;ve shared throughout this entry. She really is an adorable girl and we had such fun together on this photoshoot. You&#8217;ve got to be pretty damn special to endure a day of constant flashing in public&#8230;.and not too many models would&#8217;ve agreed to such. So, thank God for Tamara and her amazing self.</p>
<p>To say goodbye to her &#8230;.I think I&#8217;ll share one last shot of her cute self in this same outfit&#8230;.though completely covered for once! And, dang it&#8230;.. hope that she and I cross paths again. Last I heard she&#8217;s moved to Homer, Alaska, and I hope she&#8217;s not freezing to death. Maybe I can get up there next summer and share that spectacular nature with you as well as another edition of Tamara.</p>
<p>She is awesome!!!!</p>
