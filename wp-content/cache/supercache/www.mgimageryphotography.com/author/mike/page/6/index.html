			<p>New Year’s Eve day, 2009, Lake Havasu, AZ.</p>
<p>I planned on meeting my new friend, Skye, for her her Lonely Road experience. But, as a bonus, I got Skye, her friend Nicole, several off-road jeeps and a whole bunch of guys on motorcycles!! Woo Hoo….nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd, right? Well, maybe partially nude models jumping and posing on some lonely, dirt trails? (smile)</p>
<p>Skye…like so many before her…was truly completely new to this type of modeling. So, Nicole came along just for some companionship and confidence-building. And, as you’ll remember from my last entry, Nicole knew she couldn’t just watch! (FYI: anybody tagging along on my shoots is going to join in, somehow!!) But…before I jump too far ahead….guess how the initial meeting with Skye took place?? Hah, I actually met her that day at her parents’ house!! Being 19 and completely new to modeling, she asked me to come by her house and introduce myself so that her parents would be more comfortable. I actually had no problem with that as I want anyone that shoots with me to feel safe &amp; confident in what we’re doing. So, Nicole also met us there and the gals actually tried on outfits there while I chit-chatted with mom &amp; dad! Ah, another unique, new experience for the Lonely Road photographer.</p>
<p>Well…with my limited knowledge of Havasu….about the only place I was sure we could get some off-road access was on the motocross and 4-wheeler trails on the southside of town. And, being a weekend, I knew we’d have companions out there. So, imagine a dude in a Jeep seeing this gal in this attire walking towards him:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2174"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2174 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1a.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Well….if that wouldn’t cause some red-blooded American boy to stop in his tracks…what if instead he saw Skye from this perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2175"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2175 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1c.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>LOL…the guys in the jeep loved her!!! And, to her credit, she didn’t freak out too much when they approached and drove by. Of course, Nicole is just laughing her butt off the whole time. So, Skye wanted her to get a feel for what standing bare-assed on a dusty trail is like when boys cruise past! And, Nicole….brave as she is/was…..only chose a belt and see-through top for her initial opportunity:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1d-nicole-joins/" rel="attachment wp-att-2176"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2176 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1d nicole joins" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1d-nicole-joins.jpg" width="500" height="700" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1d-nicole-joins.jpg 500w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1d-nicole-joins-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Her expression says it all! Jeez, she had such a blast flashing her rump and flirting with the bikers! And, word got out pretty fast that there were a couple of semi-nude gals modeling in the area….as the rest of the afternoon we had moto-friends joining us endlessly!!  Well…back to Skye now for a couple more shots of her in that purple piece of fabric. Both she and I thought this was an ideal piece for her to wear as it covered the “NC-17” parts of her up while revealing just enough “R-rated” parts to tease. Do you like her legs?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1f/" rel="attachment wp-att-2177"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2177 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1f" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1f.jpg" width="500" height="750" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1f.jpg 500w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1f-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>She’s so athletic and strong….and I think the material exquisitely highlights her beauty and figure. Well, how about a bit of attitude and some buns!? Shooting this lady from a slightly lower angle than the similar shot up above added some great perspective to her frame and I think totally added a dramatic element to the photo! I could show off the length and shape of those incredible legs of hers while creating an angle for that booty she has to literally just JUMP out. And, LOL, I also think her….. “Dude, what the hell are you lookin’ at”….. expression enhances this shot even more:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1g/" rel="attachment wp-att-2178"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2178 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1g" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1g.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1g.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1g-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The primary reason that Skye was even interested in shooting with me for the Lonely Road book was my motion shots. Being an athlete, she was dying to get shots of herself flying through the air. So, part of what we’d done at her parent’s house was to decide on the outfits and accessories which she could perform such jumps in. The favorite of the accessories…. I’ll save for the end. But, for now, how about a gal “skying” through the air, named Skye, dressed in what looks like some suit of armor while holding a medieval sword!?  YES…exactly what you guys would have chosen too, right?! And, before she leaps…how about our motorcycle buddy saying “hi” again (you’ve gotta love Skye’s reaction) and then this lovely lady in flight while she attempts to retain modesty:</p>

<p>LOL</p>
<p>Now…I think I’ve mentioned previously that I have TONS OF SHOTS from each of my shoots. I only share some, and you don’t get to see all the outfits and you’ll either have to buy my book or wait for Lonely #2….OK. But, I wanted to share one shot of Skye and Nicole together here which totally summarizes a few things: A) their friendship  B) my stupid ideas  C) my idiotic fascination with colors and contrasts. Ready?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1j/" rel="attachment wp-att-2181"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2181 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1j" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1j.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1j.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1j-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah. Again, I think you’d all giggle at the amount of ridiculous imagery I truly have to share. But, man, the models have sooo much fun with this kind of stuff. Anyway, before you think I’m too retarded…how about two of my favorite shots from the shoot with Skye and Nicole. The first features Skye showing a bit of that bubbly bottom of hers….but also with what I think is one of her best expressions. Great shadows; she is positioned well in the cleft of the hill; she has such a lovely and peaceful look on her face…I just think it’s a good photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1k/" rel="attachment wp-att-2182"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2182 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1k" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1k.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1k.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1k-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>This second is a photograph that I’m really proud of! I happened to capture Nicole on the tips of her toes and she’s thrown a purple fabric above her head in an ideal manner! God, I probably couldn’t recreate this any better if I tried. A dramatic sky; Nicole’s body looks spectacular in it’s extension; and I think you all should send me $100 so that I can print a 16&#215;20 frameable version of this for above your fireplace!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-117-skyes-the-limit/blogsky1l/" rel="attachment wp-att-2183"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2183 colorbox-2173" alt="blogsky1l" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1l.jpg" width="500" height="700" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1l.jpg 500w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogsky1l-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Nicole blew me away. Man, she’d come along to simply help her friend, Skye, feel comfy …..and then she got the guts to partake, herself….and created something as stunning and majestic as that shot above. Wow, pretty cool, huh? I guess this reinforces the notion that when you’re given unique opportunities you should totally jump on them! Hell, you only live once and Nicole’s spontaneity was sooo rewarded with this photo (as were my time and efforts). So, people, if I ever am next to you and say that I need you to strip off your clothes in jump in front of my camera….because I have a great idea……..</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong></p>
<p>Alrighty, then. Well…..we’re now almost to the end of my Havasu entry. But, this is where I get to show you Skye’s favorite accessory for the day and also our best idea in general. Again, Skye truly is “Ms. Athletic” and really wanted to be captured in flight. So, she happened to have in her parent’s garage this vibrant, yellow hula hoop! Oh, yes, how about a naked jump while hula hooping?? Not easy to imagine but even harder to do. So……how about I just let the pictures that follow tell the story of Skye making herself book-worthy (hint, hint…..):</p>

<p>(Pretty good, don’t you think? We got lucky….as Skye did something pretty unique with her arms but I still managed to get a shot of her face through those crossed limbs. Still,I wanted to see if she could fully extend her jump and get her legs higher in the air)</p>

<p>Ah, mission accomplished!</p>
<p>Skye, Nicole, the hula hoop booty jump and a bunch of happy motorcyclists ……………..all on the Lonely Road!</p>

			<p>Hey, when you&#8217;re out in the middle of nowhere on a Lonely Road shoot&#8230;..you can get famished. I mean&#8230;&#8230;holy shit&#8230;you&#8217;re jumping and laughing and balancing and twisting and moving quickly sometimes to hide from motorcyclists who might see you naked! Yeah,&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; that wears you out!! Now, imagine the poor photographer who&#8217;s trying to keep up with you, stressing about all the details, and protecting you from leering eyes!?! Yeah, jeez, he can get &#8220;hungry as all hell&#8221; too.  So, when I&#8217;m blessed to work with someone like my incredible, cover-model friend, Franny, then there is only one food to satisfy my hunger:</p>

<p>Oh, yeah&#8230;&#8230;not every model would agree to create something SPECIAL like this for my project! Hah&#8230;FRANNY ROCKS!!! So&#8230;stay tuned for her 2nd and 3rd shoots which are forthcoming&#8230;.on&#8230;&#8230;the Lonely Road!</p>
<p>Whoooooooooooop!</p>

			<p>As the entry to this blog suggests&#8230;..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-0/" rel="attachment wp-att-2142"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2142 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 0" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-0.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-0.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-0-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah, this lovely woman is the back cover of the Lonely Road book. But, you guys should know that anyway since you’ve already bought it, right? It’s on your living room table where all of your guests can browse it and discover the artistry, beauty and humor of subtle nudity. Sure. And, FYI…all proceeds go to me &#8230;.which funds my immature ventures!!!! (90% actual go to the publisher).</p>
<p>Well, as you can see…my friend, Chelly, from blog entry #105, came back again for another round of Lonely. And, people, she’s smokin’!!! Literally and figuratively:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2144"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2144 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 2" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-2.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-2.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-2-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>She also has the god-given gifts which may prompt people to be more accepting of “cigarette butts” in public:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-2145"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2145 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 3" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-3.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-3.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-3-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah, I don’t condone unhealthy practices, LOL, and nothing good really comes from smoking. Except, maybe, Rachelle’s tanlined ass? Some people may also think standing semi-nude in nature is unhealthy, but, actually, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Dr. Ruth both recommend ass-baring exercises to rid yourself of nicotine addictions. So, if you didn’t know that, get naked and prevent cancer!!!!</p>
<p>Well, this lady is so darned awesome. She ended up shooting with me 4 times for the Lonely Road and this is only her 2<sup>nd</sup> <sup> </sup>visit!! It’s also the first where she’s brought a friend along and you’ll see more of Chelly and another friend of hers down the road! But, she truly adored this project and epitomizes what the Lonely Road is all about: Sponteneity; Beauty; Motion; Joy. I can go “on and on” with such adjectives, but this project and this lady were a perfect combination. And, once you see more of her photos….I think you’ll agree.</p>
<p>So, Chelly had brought her friend Adrienne along since she too loved photography and had heard so much about my shoots. Chelly especially LOVES the the motion stuff….so, we started the day out by having her wear only this little, pink fabric piece while trying to fly high in the air. And, yeah, our first jump attempt was literally the best. Ever?!?!?. So, here you go. The almost-perfect, super-smiley, gorgeously tanlined Lonely Road jump de Chelly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2143"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2143 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 1" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-1.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-1.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-1-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Doesn’t this totally represent happiness and motion and beauty all in one? Man, Chelly has the perfect smile, did a killer jump, I caught her expression wonderfully, and the colors are ideal! Wooo hoooo. I should never do another jumping photo again, right?  Well….no. I’ve got sooo many more I want to try. Now, how ‘bout we just turn this striking woman around and catch a similar yet different shot as she flies again through the air while showing off her fabulous tanlined bottom:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-2146"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2146 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 4" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-4.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-4.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-4-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Wahlah! Not too bad, huh? And….if your friend Adrienne has come along and we need to better demonstrate this photographers skill in capturing motion……what would you try next? Well&#8230;.here goes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-2147"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2147 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 5" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-5.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-5.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-5-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I think the focus on Adrienne is pretty cool and she also has a great expression. Well, from there I Chelly try on a white shawl which I thought looked wonderful against her tan skin. And, accessorized with black boots while positioned amidst the glorious colors of nature ….I figured it would look pretty dramatic. Hmmm…you tell me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-2148"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2148 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 6" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-6.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-6.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-6-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I just LOVE her tanlines! And, Chelly is also gifted with the ability to vary her expressions. She can be serious and sexy, playful as hell, or just full of attitude. So, to better demonstrate such……check out these shots of her just being herself and posing as we go:</p>

<p>Being comfortable in front of a camera takes time. Then, to also be skillful with expressions while modeling and being able to create “different looks” without a photographer guiding you…takes even more practice. I in turn also think that being familiar with one another…model &amp; photographer…totally helps. So, this gal was such a complete blast to work with since we’d already done a shoot previously. I also knew she loved my concepts and was completely uninhibited with her body…which makes photography like this a snap. Anyway….Chelly rocks:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-10/" rel="attachment wp-att-2152"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2152 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 10" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-10.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-10.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-10-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>From any angle or perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-2153"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2153 colorbox-2139" alt="blogRach2 12" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogRach2-12.jpg" width="450" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Well…as time and light was winding down for us, I figured it was time to drag Adrienne REALLY into the program! Yeah, you can’t just come along the Lonely Road and watch!! Screw that!  If you’re draggin’ your ass along…..you’re partaking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-13/" rel="attachment wp-att-2154"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2154 colorbox-2139" alt="blograch2 13" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-13.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-13.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blograch2-13-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah…by this time Adrienne was totally stoked to join in and add to our day’s results! And, blessed with one hell of a tanlined bubble-bottom herself, why cover her up with a peace-signed piece, right:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/115-the-lonely-road-baby-got-back-of-the-book/blograch2-14/" rel="attachment wp-att-2155"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2155 colorbox-2139" alt="blogRach2 14" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogRach2-14.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogRach2-14.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogRach2-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Well…that about wrapped up our day, folks. Both the gals were tired, we had a long drive back to my place, and the sun was almost set. And, you know, I think we all needed a drink and couldn’t wait to get to a bar. At least this is what I’m guessing Chelly had on her mind&#8230;..</p>

<p>Thanks as always for reading my blog, people. Now, damn it, tell all the cute ladies you know out there about my photography, have ‘em all call me, and let’s start creating Lonely Roads #2.<br />
GET LONELY</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Howdy, everyone! Well, today&#8217;s entry is a weee bit unique. It features 3 different ladies, none of whom made the final edition of my book, sadly. 1 is a lovely Texan who I dated during a portion of the shooting of this book. Another never signed a model release and hence I can&#8217;t use her images for a book or any project, and really just have to hide her identity. The final decided NOT to want to partake in my book after shooting &#8230;.and thus I can only tease you with a few of the entertaining shots of her&#8230;minus any of her face. Ah, the perils and challenges of the semi-nude photographer!</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s jump right to the first of the 3 gals&#8230;.who&#8217;s really, really sweet! And, holy canoli&#8230;she has a bubble butt from heaven! Yeah, years of skiing perhaps caused this? Maybe she just eats properly?? Hmm&#8230;.I&#8217;m not sure. But, these poor guys passing by missed out on one great booty to behold:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio1a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2113"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2113 colorbox-2112" alt="BlogTrio1a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BlogTrio1a.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BlogTrio1a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BlogTrio1a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>She and I had squeezed in our photo shoot on a moments notice&#8230;.but she&#8217;d luckily been able to bring some fun outfits/attire to wear: The skirt above was made with bottle caps and jingled when she walked and moved&#8230;pretty neat. And, I just loved the boots! So, how &#8217;bout another shot of this playful lady &#8230;.in those boots, doing a fabulous job of teasing the heck out of any cowboys reading this blog:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio1b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2114"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2114 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio1b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1b.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1b-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Kiss that!!! OMG&#8230;in addition to her amazing ass and legs&#8230;&#8230;jeez, she also has a killer attitude towards life and obviously one HUGE sense of humor!!</p>
<p>Would you plant a big &#8216;ole smooch on the cheeks beneath that hat??</p>
<p>Well&#8230;I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;d get a whole bunch of &#8220;yes&#8221; answers to that question if I could take a poll. And, for the final shot of my first &#8220;stealth-like&#8221; visitor today, how &#8217;bout we say goodbye to this curvacious and athletic cowgirl by watching her fly through the air:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio1c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2115"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2115 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio1c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1c.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio1c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;you can&#8217;t get much cuter or find more spontaneous a person than this sweet friend of mine, and I hope you dug her shots.</p>
<p>Now, my next mystery participant has an awesome story to tell. She and I shot on a day that the new 303 Freeway had just opened up in NW Phoenix. Very few cars were even using it yet, so, I figured nobody would mind if we just double-parked along the side and had some fun. Yes, &#8220;fun&#8221;, clad only in gorgeous panties to flaunt your amazing legs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio2a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2116"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2116 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio2a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2a.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2a-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I love using depth of field for some of my photos&#8230;.and, zooming through this vixen&#8217;s limbs makes for a pretty unique shot of the location&#8217;s signage, huh? So, imagine if you&#8217;re a truck driver cruising along this new stretch of road and this lady is standing there waving at you. Would you be offended? Would you get into an accident? Or&#8230;&#8230;just maybe&#8230;&#8230;would you want to give her your package?????</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio2aa/" rel="attachment wp-att-2117"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2117 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio2aa" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2aa.jpg" width="650" height="464" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2aa.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2aa-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2aa-420x300.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Heck yes!!!!! And, this guy didn&#8217;t crash and definitely would have offered her his package, right? So, we kept playing and letting cars check out her incredible panty-clad bottom&#8230;..and, she even did some handstands and jumps along the 303. But, I think it was her rump in those panties which truly inspired the motorists passing by:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio2b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2118"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2118 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio2b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2b.jpg" width="650" height="464" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2b.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2b-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2b-420x300.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>So&#8230;.that&#8217;s when things got a bit more entertaining and interesting for us. For, the next passerby really didn&#8217;t pass by. He stopped&#8230;with his lights flashing. Oh, yeah, Johnny Law! LOL&#8230;..I guess the cops even were drawn to this ass. Well, it was 2 state patrol officers who actually got out of the car and of course they were seemingly pissed at me for being on the side of the highway, causing a potential accident. One was new and a bit nerdy..and he took our Driver&#8217;s Licenses and went back to his car to &#8220;call us in&#8221; and check to see if we were felons. His buddy just hung there with my lovely, panty-clad model and I&#8230;. and eventually just started shooting the shit with us. He obviously realized we weren&#8217;t hurting anyone and also told us his buddy was brand new to law enforcement and had to do things by the book. But, the cool cop basically told us it was illegal to stop along a highway and that we could cause an accident by being there. He also, though, LOVED checking out this amazing lady and then took my card to be able to stay in touch with my work. So, Officer ?????, I hope you&#8217;re reading this entry right now, man! Anyway, the new cop eventually got out of his car, came back to us looking as serious and stern as ever, and warned us that we were breaking the law by stopping along the highway. Dangerous for us and potentially harmful to others. He didn&#8217;t offer to spank my model but maybe should have&#8230;and they then took off. But, it was nice of them not to ticket us for anything and I think my beautiful partner and that bottom of hers SAVED the day.</p>
<p>So, to wrap up our afternoon&#8230;we then had this lovely lady grab the skateboard we brought along. She also donned a different pair of panties, and, here&#8217;s one of my favorite shots from this portion of our shoot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio2c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2119"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2119 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio2c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2c.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Great lighting, awesome colors&#8230;.and I love the low angle perpective. How &#8217;bout the panties?? Better than those coral ones we used earlier? Hmmm&#8230;.you can decide! Well, the lawmen would have been more pleased this time as we did park up off of the highway and just walked a few yards down an on ramp for this shot. And, to then wrap up the shoot completely and also give the officers one more reason to lock us up for life&#8230;..we had my lovely friend mount that board of hers and cruise towards traffic:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio2d/" rel="attachment wp-att-2120"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2120 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio2d" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2d.jpg" width="475" height="665" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2d.jpg 475w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio2d-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a></p>
<p>Ah, yeah. I bit of risk and a bit of rump along the Lonely Road!</p>
<p>Alrighty, I have one more amazing model still to share with you before I wrap up today&#8217;s entry. And, this lady is a true-blooded Texan, works a corporate job, needs her identity protected, and just loves Digital Impressions in Dentistry!  She&#8217;s spontaneous, gutsy and truly just lovely&#8230;and, I hope when she reads this she realizes just how awesome I think she is!</p>
<p>Anyway, Ms. Texas and I only had a couple hours to shoot one afternoon in late 2010 before she was on a plane back to that BIG STATE. So, she raided my Lonely Roads wardrobe, came up with some fun outfits, and we drove out to the desert to take a few photos.</p>
<p>How sexy are her legs and booty in these red boots with this stiped skirt?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio3a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2121"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2121 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio3a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3a.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Well, if you really like the skirt, maybe you can catch me wearing it @ Burning Man this summer! Anywho&#8230;I just think she looks so cute&#8230;.as she&#8217;s obviously having fun based on that smile peeking under her bangs. And, who wouldn&#8217;t have fun posing topless and bare-assed in nature, right? 🙂 Yeah! Well, Ms. Texas and those legs of hers in &#8220;them thar&#8221; maroon boots sure works for me. Boo yah!</p>
<p>Now, the outfit she and I were really stoked to have her play with involved this long cape which I&#8217;d bought for Halloween. Can you say&#8230;..&#8221;Batgirl&#8221;??  Well, I just couldn&#8217;t wait to see Ms. Texas wear it as a cape with nothing else on but her black boots and some gloves. We figured she could drape it over her shoulders and twist it around to &#8220;cover what needed to be covered&#8221;&#8230;while still allowing us to catch the beautiful lines of her body:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-114-triple-whammy/blogtrio3c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2122"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122 colorbox-2112" alt="blogTrio3c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3c.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blogTrio3c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Whataya think? MMM, MMM good is my answer! This woman is blessed with such a lovely and real body. Now,  I do also apologize for the black box&#8230;but I had to try to protect her from too much recognition. At least you can enjoy that stunning figure of hers&#8230;and hopefully laugh at the stupid text I added to reinforce my &#8220;stealth&#8221; approach! Anyway, I just adore this lady and think the semi-translucent black material of that cape against her skin is divine. It makes me want to change their motto to&#8230;..&#8221;Mess with Texas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;. I hope you approve of all you saw today and that you, like me, think unidentified mystery stealth models&#8230;&#8230;TOTALLY ROCK!</p>
<p>Until next time&#8230;..</p>

			<p>Remember the body-building Amazonian goddess I featured in entry #69? Well, this super-intelligent and beautiful lady got a 2<sup>nd</sup> opportunity to work with me before she left the state of AZ to pursue bigger, better and much more legal things!!!!! J And, we chose an interesting location for our 2<sup>nd</sup> photoshoot: Vistancia! For those that have not been to Phoenix and traveled on the NW side of this endless sprawl, Vistancia is a master-planned community in the middle of BFE! An hour drive from Sky Harbor Airport, 20 minutes from the nearest Starbucks,… this place is remote. It’s also uber-vanilla and dull….so, what better way to liven up their world than to have Leslie flash some of her spectacular assets amidst their surroundings! Oh, yeah………let’s have some fun!</p>
<p>Now, I will again remind you all that my goal is to NEVER offend anyone.  I don’t want to cause older folks to have heart attacks; I am very cautious to avoid any children; and….I don’t want my models arrested for indecency! But, that being said, it is fun to know that the folks passing by usually have no idea what we’re doing and also usually can’t even tell that a booty or boob is involved in the picture. It’s just a secret for my model, me and any of you following this blog or <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">buying my book</span></b>. Anyway, that type of photo is part of what you’ll see today from Leslie and I:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2084"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2084 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4a.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah. An old Chevy, her see-thru dress, and lots of color!  Well, circumstances like this really make me giggle and I truly hope that the people I have encountered in situations like this also get a kick out of the experience. Some smile and have no clue what we’re doing. Some pause and stare back and start to realize that my models are scantily clad. A few even stop and introduce themselves!</p>
<p>Well…let’s get going with Leslie on her 2<sup>nd</sup> Lonely Road visit. As you can see in that first picture, she chose to bring a pretty spectacular see-thru dress with her. And, by adding the yellow heels and belt, I think we were able to accessorize perfectly. A great contrast to the black of her hair and the black of the dress….but, also the perfect match to the sign that we had her stand next to with those yellow and black stripes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2086"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2086 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4b.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4b-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>And, how about the pinwheel spinning hair on Leslie? I thought that was a unique touch to add to the shot especially since the curvy road sign was also right next to her. “Motion” to me just brings a unique element to photography and whether it’s a jump or some hair flying….it just adds some energy to an otherwise static photo. So, maybe you also spin Leslie around, get her hair in motion once more, but highlight those spectacular legs of hers!</p>

<p>How&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>Well….I better show you another featuring one of the many visitors that passed by us that morning:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4d/" rel="attachment wp-att-2088"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2088 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4d" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4d.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4d.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4d-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Excuse me. But, how perfect is this woman’s ass? I mean….come on! Wow, Leslie….. squats work! Really. !! Pretty lucky how we perfectly blocked that driver’s identity too, huh? They may have otherwise been too close to be anonymous and I didn’t feel like running after them to get a model release anyway. So, what more could we do here with Leslie in her fabulous black dress?!?!? Oh, yeah, we could just have her flash that epic booty of hers and then twist towards us so that we can see more of her pretty face…..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4e/" rel="attachment wp-att-2089"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2089 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4e" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4e.jpg" width="450" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Well, at this point Leslie and I had seen plenty of cars driving by and decided that for the next portion of our shoot we’d find an area with a little more privacy. So, at the back edge of the Vistancia subdivision we found a little side road that offered more interesting signage and some high voltage lines. What better way could you energize your morning???</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4g/" rel="attachment wp-att-2091"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2091 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4g" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4g.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4g.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4g-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Leslie sprawled out on that block, dressed in purple, is pretty sexy, huh? And, as you’ve also clearly seen, the strength and muscularity of this woman is just insane. So, together she and I tried to find some “looks” that would best flatter her features. How ‘bout this silver top, silver heels and a stringy skirt:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4h/" rel="attachment wp-att-2092"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4h" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4h.jpg" width="450" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Leslie’s body is sheer artwork. And, I think this pose beautifully highlights that figure of hers. I also loved the expression on Leslie’s face in this shot! She’s confident, “copping” some attitude, and it just works perfectly with her body language. Soooo…how ‘bout I now remind everyone of the amazing dressing room my models get to work in! It’s classy, very discreet, and I promise the utmost in privacy when you’re changing into your next wardrobe:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4j/" rel="attachment wp-att-2093"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2093 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4j" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4j.jpg" width="650" height="464" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4j.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4j-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4j-420x300.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Wooo frickin&#8217; Hoooo!!! Leslie, I so appreciate you and your lack of shame!</p>
<p>Well….this lady and I capped off her day by highlighting that incredible body of hers in simply a long, red scarf. She accentuated it with a cute, red headband and some killer red heels….and you’ll have to let me know if you think Leslie in this look is as striking as I find it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-113-musclemania-returns-feb-13-2010/bloglr4m/" rel="attachment wp-att-2094"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2094 colorbox-2082" alt="blogLR4m" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4m.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4m.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogLR4m-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I guess she&#8217;s telling me where to go, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway, with a gesture like that it&#8217;s probably time to wrap up this photoshoot but also wrap up Lelie and her amazing figure as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting…..</p>

			<p>If you were a motorcyclist, riding around with your buddies on some winding, dirt roads and you suddenly encountered a lovely, semi-naked woman, would you ride away, disgusted?? Probably not! No, sort of like the guys you’re going to see during this Lonely Road entry, I’d hang around, maybe ride by a few times, totally check the lady out and definitely get my money’s worth! Well….Jes and her curvaceous self, did mesmerize some young motorcyclists on her first visit to my project….and it’s just part of what you’ll see from her today.   She’s going to smile, jump laugh, flash her booty and have soooo much fun during this photoshoot that you’ll see her again in another entry very, very soon.  And, though she’s now a mother and happily married, I’m guessing she’d schedule another shoot with me whenever possible! Right, Jes?!?!?!  Yeah, I adore gals like this who so embraced my zany project and just rocked it! And, without further ado, why don’t you let Jes say “hello” before I say anything else about her:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2054"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2054 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1a.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Isn’t she just a naturally lovely and curvaceous woman? Man, the ideal model for my project as she doesn’t wear much makeup, prefers super-simple outfits that fit her personality, did this on a whim and as a hobby, and had no problem flirting &amp; playing with the folks that encountered us during our shoot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2055"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2055 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1b.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1b-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>LOL. I don’t want to cause accidents…but, that guy and his buddies just LOVED this lady. And, you’ll see more of them coming up as they kept great track of where we were at and kept cruising by to check this lady out! Heck….can you blame them? Well…once those guys had driven out of sight initially, and we had a moment with no one gawking, Jes decided to take “sexy” up a notch:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2056"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2056 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1c.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, the key to this shot is that we had her look down the road to see if another biker might be coming. I think this just makes you move your eyes all over the shot as you wonder what she’s looking at. Also, holding the top in front of her, up high, allowed us to contrast the black top to that white/grey sky and create some nice contrast. Again, my attempt at creating “more” in a shot that just intrigues the viewer. And, finally, by having her twist a bit, we could truly accent that amazingly curvy bottom of hers…clad in those cute, pink panties….right in front of the “road closed” sign. Man, lots going on here…but, to me all of this creates a more memorable shot.</p>
<p>Well…Jes and her bubble butt are quite a combination! And, with awesome tanlines to boot…I wanted to find ways to tease viewers with her sexy curves without just having her stand there completely naked. So…..how about this shot from an overhead perspective?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1d/" rel="attachment wp-att-2057"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2057 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1d" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1d.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1d.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1d-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>A peek of those cheeks; Jes acting shy and covering her chest while sneaking a glance at her booty! Well, I hope you approve…as I think this is so damned cute and totally fits this lady and her personality. Yeah, nothing like leaving a little to your imagination…..</p>
<p>By now you all must clearly understand that my dressing room for Lonely Road photoshoots isn’t very classy. No…it’s the back of my truck/standing in the road while you hurry up and switch outfits. And, as always, I try to capture these moments for future entertainment:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1f/" rel="attachment wp-att-2058"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2058 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1f" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1f.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1f.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1f-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Classy, huh? 🙂</p>
<p>Well, Jes a blast with this whole project, and, the outfit she was changing into was her own idea…a simple, polka dot dress! Totally befitting of “the girl next door”, but wait till you see what we had her do while wearing this dress!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1g/" rel="attachment wp-att-2059"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2059 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1g" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1g.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1g.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1g-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Jes has balls, people!</p>
<p>OMG, several vehicles had already passed by us and I thought it would be fun to take a shot of her mooning one of them. So, I lined her up in such a way, this time, that we could see the approaching car from between her legs while also capturing her facial reaction to the impending situation. Jes is loving it though she’s clearly a bit nervous. And, fyi, the guy behind the wheel of that jeep was smiling HUGE when he passed me&#8230;while his girlfriend next to him just sneered. Hah! She even yelled at us out the window. Well…I guess you can’t make everyone laugh, especially jealous girlfriends!</p>
<p>Anyway, Jes embraced all of my wacky ideas…no matter how stupid they were. Case in point: I keep a roll of toilet paper in my truck to use as Kleenex….and, I figured we could  create a “mother nature is calling” photograph using that  item. So, in her polka dot dress……Jes and I went to work and here is what we came up with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl1h/" rel="attachment wp-att-2060"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2060 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL1h" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1h.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1h.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL1h-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Who do you think created that wet spot? Jes or me? Or, was it a coyote?? Hmmm…..we may have to leave that up to you and your imagination. Butt……I think this shot rocks! Not many photographers could create this shot, LOL! True genius art!!! And, not many models would even consider partaking in this idea. That is why JesL is so fabulous. Man, she giggled at all of my stupid suggestions and had such fun working with me. And, rather than continuing to tell you this….why don’t you hear it from this lovely lady herself:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl2-whats-it-like-to-moon-people/" rel="attachment wp-att-2065">What&#8217;s it like to Moon People</a></p>
<p>The last thing that Jes and I wanted to shoot that day involved motion. Yeah, she was stoked to do some jumping pictures and the smile on her face in these shots will simply reaffirm how much she enjoyed this day. Now, when you shoot motion photography and have your models scantily clad….you’ve got to be careful that everything stays covered properly. Case in point…..look at this perfect shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2066"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2066 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3a.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3a-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Jes is smiling; she’s fully extended; her breasts are covered by that flimsy, purple scarf. But, it doesn’t always turn out perfectly. Here is the shot that preceded that one….and, you’ll see that something sort of slipped out!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2067"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2067 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3b.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3b-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>LOL, the challenge of my work!! I also had centered her body right in front of the road as it stretched to the horizon, and, I really don’t think that was nearly as good a perspective as the previous image where you can see that road in the distance. I also told you that those motorcyclists were all about keeping in touch with curvaceous Miss Jes, right? Well….here’s one of our buddies again:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2068"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2068 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3c.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3c.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3c-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>By this time Jes was loving the fact that those boys were obsessed with her and was also ready to give them a show:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3d/" rel="attachment wp-att-2069"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2069 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3d" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3d.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3d.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3d-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Isn’t she adorable? God, she’s got such  wonderful curves and those tanlines around her cheeks just draw even more attention. I also love the fact that she’d chosen to wear the multi-colored slippers for this portion of the shoot as they look so bizarre! Hah!! But, for me, it’s just another to a shot which makes my eyes move all over! Her slippers, her butt, her eyes, the road, those colorful tattoos, the pink/purple panties….there’s just a bunch going on. And, oh yeah, as soon as that bottom of her was revealed……..here came those bikers for a closer look&#8230;with the supremely confident, playful and bootilicious Jes blowing their mind with a wave &amp; smile:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3e/" rel="attachment wp-att-2076"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2076 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3e" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3e.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3e.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3e-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Wooo Hooo…..I bet Jes was having more fun than those lucky boys who were getting’ a chance to checkout that ass of hers! And, if you buy my book, you may just have this specific photo on your coffee table for a lifetime! HINT, HINT, HINT. Well, she smiled, laughed and couldn’t wait for the next guy to come by. And, sure enough….he wasn’t far behind the first biker:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3f/" rel="attachment wp-att-2077"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2077 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3f" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3f.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3f.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3f-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Dang! &#8220;Old Yeller&#8221; just couldn&#8217;t get enough of Jes!!! Well….I hope you appreciate the guts of this lady as she stood nearly naked on this dirt road and waved and flashed. Clearly, she was having a ball but not everyone is capable of exhibiting such comfort amidst potential adversity. Well, Jes sure got a kick out of her day with me and I think I’ll leave you with one last PG shot of her jumping for joy and celebrating life:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-112-jan-10-2010-jes-and-her-biker-buddies/blogjesl3g/" rel="attachment wp-att-2078"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2078 colorbox-2052" alt="blogJesL3g" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3g.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3g.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogJesL3g-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Jes and her first visit to the Lonely!</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting and I&#8217;ll see you again soon….</p>

			<p>Today I&#8217;m telling the story of the gal who&#8217;s become my website cover model and fabulous friend! She&#8217;s shot with me 3 times, gone to Burning Man with me, makes me smile HUGE and is a huge reason why my website, photography and life are AWESOME! Yeah, say &#8220;hi&#8221; to Franny! FYI&#8230;.you&#8217;ve seen her before&#8230;..way back when&#8230;.when I did a teaser video of &#8220;what happens when a car goes by&#8221;! Yes, entry #60A. So, once you read thru this post you may want to go back and watch her in that video so you can hear her laugh and better envision what it&#8217;s like on the Lonely Road with this incredible lady!</p>
<p>So, Franny rocks! Nobody who shot with me in the initial round of the Lonely Road had nearly as much fun as this gal. She just exudes personality and a yearning to live&#8230;.and totally embraced the notion of standing naked on a road while cars and motorcycles drive by! Hah! Not for everyone. But, once we met, she saw more of my work and then experienced my own energy and zest for wacky, unique images&#8230;..she was totally onboard. And, I guess that&#8217;s what started our friendship.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.let me quit talkin&#8217; and get going, right! I&#8217;m also jumping &#8220;out of order&#8221; with this shoot as Franny and I met on May 1st, 2011 for this particular entry. Other models shot with me between LadyK and Franny&#8230;.but, I just had to share this segment in honor of my cover model!! I just adore Franny and I&#8217;m hoping that while she&#8217;s in Germany on her semester abroad, that she can look at this post and just giggle that amazing ass of her&#8217;s off! And, speaking of butts, how can anyone waste time following Kim Kardashian when you can follow Franny on the Lonely? Yeah&#8230;.well&#8230;&#8230;maybe we can all help make the change!?</p>
<p>We met near San Diego, on May 1st, 2011. Actually, we met at the Starbucks just off Exit 32, on Interstate 8, at the town of Alpine, in the foothills east of San Diego on your way to El Centro. Maybe we were headed to El Centro for Cinco de Mayo?? Hmm&#8230;hadn&#8217;t thought of that. But, Franny and I had spoke on the phone and had no idea we&#8217;d click so well. We grabbed a coffee, quickly picked some outfits for the shoot, and this F-IN brave lady climbed in my truck to go &#8220;create&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the way to our location, we talked about my photo project, her perspective on my work and concepts, what drove her with modeling, and what her passions were in life! And, man, we&#8217;re sort of kindred spirits! I guess that helps create the  comfort that a photographer and model need to shoot together&#8230;..&#8217;cause this gal and I just gelled. AS YOU WILL SEE!</p>
<p>Now, not everyone can meet a stranger, completely disrobe in front of them, and stand naked on a semi-busy road while numerous travels go by! (SMILE) But, Franny sure as shit can! So, without further ado&#8230;..lemme give you an idea of the setting for this shoot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn1a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2016"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2016 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN1a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1a.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1a-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, yes. Gorgeous mountain pass; picturesque, winding road complete with fabulous, yellow lines; weekend travelers enjoying life while seeing dramatic scenery; a stunning, nearly nude woman adorned in 70&#8217;s boots, a belt and a fun fur hat! Right&#8230;..EVERYTHING a Lonely Road photographer could need.</p>
<p>But, imagine this situation for the first time? I mean here was Franny, hardly knowing me, not really sure who was in the car&#8230;.and that &#8220;challenge&#8221; sort of shows in her body language! She&#8217;s covering her boobs up, probably smiling uncomfortably at these passersby&#8230;.and not looking too confident.</p>
<p>Yet!</p>
<p>Give this KILLER woman some time, guys&#8230;.as she rocked this situation to the point that she&#8217;s the image on my main page! Anyway&#8230;.it is easier to look cute, sexy and confident when no cars are approaching:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn1b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2017"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2017 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN1b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1b.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN1b-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t she stunning? Yeah, and cute as hell in that little getup of hers! She truly is just gorgeous and has a smile that must melt men. Well&#8230;.this road and location had moments where we could hear no cars approaching, but, it was a beautiful weekend day and traffic was constant. So, lets jump ahead and see Franny when the next car came by. Yeah. I had her face me for this shot so that the car coming could checkout that amazing booty of hers&#8230;..and you can see she&#8217;s still a weee bit uncomfy! Hah, she&#8217;s just giggling and nervous yet having a complete blast&#8230;.as you&#8217;ll see when that car passes, she twists around, and then smiles back at me:</p>

<p>Woo Hoo, pretty fun, huh? Well&#8230;it only got better as the amazing Franny adjusted to the situation. Now you&#8217;ll see her facing a car, still covering up and a bit &#8220;shy&#8221;&#8230;and then smiling back at me once she turned back to face me:</p>

<p>Man, how cute and adorable can any one person be? Well, her level of cuteness sure did make the people passing by smile big. They honked, shared their approval, and seemed to truly enjoy &#8220;running into&#8221; Franny and I. Hmm&#8230;maybe we should skip church more often on Sundays and just run around naked in public? Good idea?? 🙂</p>
<p>Well, anyway, Franny started getting more and more comfortable. She is a gifted model and so great with poses and expressions&#8230;..and you&#8217;ll see one here! Also, you&#8217;ll see that we entertained cars, vans and a whole lot more during our shoot. And, I also can&#8217;t decide if it was her smile or her bottom that drew the most approving glances?!?!?</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s her smile and her attitude towards LIFE!!!</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.we started to looking forward to more cars coming by, as Franny, and her growing level of comfort, was having such a great time and getting a kick out of how folks reacted to her. So, checkout this shot of her as the first of many motorcyclists shows his appreciation for Lonely Roads photography:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn2a/" rel="attachment wp-att-2030"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2030 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN2a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2a.jpg" width="450" height="630" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2a.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2a-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah, pretty fantastic!</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t want to cause accidents or offend anyone with my pictures. I think Franny and I did well to get an idea of who might be approaching and cover her up if needed. We also chose a location that wasn&#8217;t near Chucky Cheese&#8217;s or something that might draw the wrong audience, as remote winding roads also bring the type of traveler more at ease with my images. And, motorcyclists LOVE cute girls standing naked on roads. Man, that&#8217;s what life is all about:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn2b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2031"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2031 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN2b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2b.jpg" width="450" height="675" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2b.jpg 450w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN2b-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, man, this is one of my all-tiime favorites! Franny is completely at ease, rockin&#8217; the perfect pose, our timing was ideal&#8230;.in getting the bikers in between her legs&#8230;.and this is that shot that will carry me all the way to Ansel Adam&#8217;s fame! Maybe? But, you can see how her comfort with the situation and her ability to embrace the circumstances truly made this shot rock. She&#8217;s not nervous. She&#8217;s twisted her torso to accentuate that amazing bottom of hers, and we just caught an image at the perfect moment. Or, at least, the perfect Lonely Road moment!!</p>
<p>Well, the last moments of this portion of our shoot were with Franny down on her tummy in the middle of the road! Hah, another example of how KILLER this lady is. Yeah, there&#8217;s dirt on roads. Yeah, the asphalt can be cold. But, a truly amazing model realizes that you often don&#8217;t get two chances in life&#8230;.and that model jumps at the opportunity to capture something fun:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn5/" rel="attachment wp-att-2044"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2044 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN5" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN5.jpg" width="700" height="980" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN5.jpg 700w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN5-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Can you say &#8220;perfect butt&#8221;? I mean&#8230;.come on! Wow. And, LOL, I took the liberty to guess as to what Franny&#8217;s perspective of my photography is&#8230;and I hope you enjoy that little bonus in this shot.</p>
<p>Now, do you recognize this shot? Oh, yeah. My cover model. Franny:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-111-franny-arrives-may-1-2011/blogfn4/" rel="attachment wp-att-2043"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2043 colorbox-2013" alt="blogFN4" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN4.jpg" width="650" height="433" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN4.jpg 650w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN4-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogFN4-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Her rump; her expressions; her smile; her lack of fear; her sheer enthusiasm for this type of photography&#8230;I guess the whole combination of what Franny &#8220;is&#8221; &#8230;..helped make this shoot so incredible. She and I were blessed with perfect day, an ideal road, and just a lot of things coming together. But, more than anything, it was me finding a friend and model who so enjoyed this type of work. Yeah, Franny. The amazing Ms. Franny who you&#8217;ll see so much more of as we continue to travel the Lonely Road. And, till I see you again&#8230;.a bit of Franny&#8217;s fearlessness, sexiness and overall attitude towards life&#8230;&#8230;as we bid you farewell:</p>

			<p>Remember entry #92, lovely Lady K? Well&#8230;..this fabulous friend of mine returns and you&#8217;ll get something unique to start this contribution: A non-outdoor photograph! Oh, yeah, some of the gals I shoot with also do some studio shots with me&#8230;.so, this contribution is a little bit more than just contrasting gals to nature on empty, winding paths. This time, you also get Lady K, her beauty, her attitude and&#8230;&#8230;.and&#8230;&#8230;.and&#8230;&#8230;my black dresser:</p>

<p>Whataya think? Well..it&#8217;s different than the Lonely project and I may just have to start sharing some more of what I do so that you realize I have different versions of art in my skillset! Ooh yeah. Anyway&#8230;.you may see more of this as I wind up today&#8217;s entry&#8230;since Lady K did come and shoot this studio session with me shortly after her 2nd Lonely photoshoot. But&#8230;.let&#8217;s get back to the Lonely Road for now.</p>
<p>Lady K is just a damn blast! She&#8217;s cute as hell, spontaneous as can be, and HAS NO FEAR. So, amidst the cool, colorful and artistic shots we&#8217;re going to show you today&#8230;.you&#8217;re also going to see this fabulous and stunning woman taking some risks on a pretty busy road! Oh, yeah, you can&#8217;t truly be a Lonely Roads model FAVORITE unless you can show some booty while cars go by! And, if you&#8217;re conservative or think that passing motorists don&#8217;t appreciate some cute cheeks or a lovely smile on a gal in translucent panties&#8230;well&#8230;&#8230;guess again:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1986"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1986 colorbox-1984" alt="blogKs2" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogKs2.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogKs2.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogKs2-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah! This picture made my book and it wasn&#8217;t staged at all. During Lady K&#8217;s second shoot, out on that busy road, this biker happened to pass and express his appreciation for her pantied cheeks and gorgeous smile! Wooo Hooo, Lonely!</p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m jumping the gun since this portion of the shoot happened later in our day. The first thing &#8220;K&#8221; and I did in our 2nd go around was head to this road right behind my house that was easy to access and offered a picturesque mountain backdrop. Now Lady K loves the color red&#8230;and you&#8217;ll see her in a bunch of it today! Red also is a perfect contrast to the blue of the sky which is so prevalent in my outdoor work. So&#8230;check her out in this sexy dress&#8230;.both laughing and just being herself and then copping a sexy pose:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks2a/" rel="attachment wp-att-1988"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks2a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks2a.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks2a.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks2a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I adore models with boatloads of personality&#8230;.but you can see that getting serious and looking sultry really added a ton to the shot! Not that I don&#8217;t like her laughing&#8230;but, if you&#8217;re looking for sexy &#8230;.you gotta have some attitude. And, Lady K has a ton! Wow&#8230;what do you think of that dress and shoe combo?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.to take sexy to another level&#8230;you then can have your model start to tease a bit, show a bit more skin:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1989"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1989 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks3" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks3.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks3.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks3-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah, I love LadyK and her frame in profile. The light on her face, highlighting her eyes&#8230;and her lean figure so upright. Well&#8230;.I think it rocks. But, you can also show a weee bit more cheek and maybe even add another level of sexy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks4/" rel="attachment wp-att-1990"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1990 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks4" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks4.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks4.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks4-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>Is that better? Or, just sexier? Well&#8230;remember that I said Lady K loves the color red? Well&#8230;there is one very obvious reason why she adores that color&#8230;and I&#8217;ve not turned her the proper way yet to reveal that. So&#8230;..hmm&#8230;.let&#8217;s spin her around a bit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks5/" rel="attachment wp-att-1991"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks5" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>How&#8217;s that? Yeah, Lady K, her absolutely perfect bottom and that tattoo of the luscious, red lips! Well, having a model who also can create that perfect look to flash when you have her expose her tattooed ass helps a bit as well. Hmmm&#8230;.Lady K in all her glory! But, you may also find that a lower angle or lower perspective also adds something to this type of shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks5a/" rel="attachment wp-att-1992"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1992 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks5a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5a.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5a.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks5a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Lady K is not very tall. But, using a low perspective in combination with her heels makes those fabulous legs of hers unending! And, we also can bring in more of the landscape in the distance, which adds some color and helps draw your eyes around to other portions of the photo. It&#8217;s stall hard to miss that epic ass of hers&#8230;but, this angle also brings in the stunning sky and clouds and also brings more light onto that face of hers.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;we eventually tired of this location and then decided to go checkout a busier road, out near Lake Pleasant, where I knew we&#8217;d find some cars going by that might appreciate a perfect booty! 🙂</p>
<p>New River Road runs from I-17 down to the Carefree Highway, right near Lake Pleasant. Its&#8217; got bends, rolling hills and offers a pretty spectacular setting for photographers that like flashing motorists!! And, you also can see pretty far in the distance to properly judge who&#8217;s coming in order to best protect your model and those that might not be as interested in my work! LOL. But, Lady K is ideal for this type of thing. Again, she&#8217;s got no fear and was totally stoked to try some of this type of imagery. So&#8230;we started her off easy&#8230;..just waiving at a van going by, wearing see-through undies that pretty much covered her up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks6/" rel="attachment wp-att-1997"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks6" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6.jpg" width="900" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6.jpg 900w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>You think that looks fun? Well&#8230;she clearly enjoyed it! So&#8230;I then thought we could have her stand in such a way that we could see cars approaching through her legs, and use depth of field, to create some different types of perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks6a/" rel="attachment wp-att-1998"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1998 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks6a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6a.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6a.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a> <a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks6b/" rel="attachment wp-att-1999"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1999 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks6b" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6b.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6b.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6b-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>How about these? Do you like the different points of focus? By shooting late in the afternoon, Lady K and I have really great lighting for these shots that help us get such great shadows on the road. And, for me, the shadows, colors, cars approaching&#8230;.all of that adds different elements that make my photos more complete. At least to me. Now, they may not be super-sexy&#8230;but I hope you find them fun and unique. And, if you want a wee bit more &#8220;sexy&#8221;&#8230;.well, we can always turn this lovely lady around and have her drop her undies. You know, sort of look naughty. And, OMG&#8230;.this is where &#8220;guts&#8221; came into play BIG with my lovely model:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-road-100-ladyk-is-back/blogks6c/" rel="attachment wp-att-2000"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000 colorbox-1984" alt="blogks6c" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6c.jpg" width="600" height="900" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6c.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogks6c-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I just think this type of shot is so fun! And, Lady K did too. We tried to make sure that whoever was approaching didn&#8217;t see too much&#8230;but, the guy that happened to be in this car was all smiles&#8230;..even though we had her pull up her panties fast as soon as I snapped this one. But, the yellow lines between her legs, those perfect cheeks of hers, the shadow, the headlights&#8230;.I hope there are a bunch of elements that draw your eyes all over this shot. I&#8217;m guessing they come back to that rump of Lady K&#8217;s quite frequently&#8230;.but it&#8217;s her personality and zest for fun that really made this shot.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;after this we didn&#8217;t have much time left in our day. So, we headed to a dirt trail minutes from this location and shot a few pics of this lovely lady in a black hat and gloves. As you&#8217;ll see, she truly is covered in vivid artwork and she&#8217;s also just gifted with amazing eyes. Anyway, in setting sunlight, the black was a wonderful contrast to her porcelain skin and I just love the light effected her incredible eyes:</p>

<p>Well folks, that about wraps up my 2nd and final shoot with Lady K from Dec. 23, 2009. Ooops, I shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;fina&#8221;l as I am hoping we shoot again soon&#8230;.but, that was the last shoot of ours for the initial Lonely Road book. Now, just go buy it so you can see some more of Lady K.</p>
<p>And&#8230;..as promised&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll send you away with one last image of this starlet from our black dresser studio shoot. An &#8220;antiqued&#8221; picture featuring that amazing behind which I hope you&#8217;ve not tired of. I thank you again for checking out my series and blog and encourage you to make up an email (so your spouse or boss doesn&#8217;t see that you&#8217;re watching this kind of stuff&#8230;.) and leave me a comment on what you think. And, until my next entry&#8230;&#8230;..Lady K and the dresser:</p>

			<p>Shhhhhh!</p>
<p>It’s May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2010, and we’re on a top-secret, stealth, under-the-radar photo-shoot with a lovely lady who MUST remain unidentified. I know…that same old story from me on why do employers, family &amp; friends judge…..but I’m not going to waste more time on it. Bottom-line? She’s got a job that wouldn’t appreciate this type of endeavor and she still wanted to do it! That’s pretty cool! She sees the human body as a beautiful work of art and is completely proud &amp; capable of standing naked on a road or train tracks and truly expressing herself! HELLO, society…I’ve found you a role-model! A modern-day, scantily-clad Susan B. Anthony? Anyway&#8230;that&#8217;s why you see a blank line in the post&#8217;s title. We have NO IDEA who this person modeling for us today is!!! 🙂</p>
<p>For me, “The Lonely Road” is all about showing bodies as art pieces. There is an added element of shock through some interesting public situations, but, the majority of my photography is all about color, motion and the stunning female form!  My guest today, “Ms. Stealth” is 6’ 1” and very athletic! And, that came in super-handy during our shoot…especially when we stumbled upon the railroad tracks you’re about to see!</p>
<p>We chose a day to work together that was beautiful and clear but also, sadly, super-windy!  That caused major dust issues for my lovely friend, but, she toughed it out and created some killer shots and memories! She briefly ran into a couple of young motorcyclers who were ecstatic to be treated to gorgeous semi-nude women! She tried some of my motion photography amidst those strong breezes and also played with colors a ton! With such perfect sunlight to work with, I think her long and immaculate frame looked wonderful draped in vivid green:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-109-_____________/blogtuc/" rel="attachment wp-att-1968"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1968 colorbox-1966" alt="blogTuc" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>But, we wanted something a bit more dramatic for her shoot. So…..we drove a bit farther into nature and ran smack-dab into some picture-perfect railroad tracks! Nothing cluttering the view, just gorgeous, symmetric ties of wood winding off into the distance. And, by adding the fabulous Ms. Stealth and her glorious back-bend…we figured we had something pretty cool:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-109-_____________/blogtuc1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1969"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1969 colorbox-1966" alt="blogTuc1" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc1.jpg" width="600" height="429" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc1.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc1-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc1-419x300.jpg 419w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>The only challenge was to decide the right framing for her on those rails. I thought my angle was too low in doing the horizontal, low perspective, so, we repositioned and got this shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-109-_____________/blogtuc2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1970"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1970 colorbox-1966" alt="blogTuc2" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>Better?</p>
<p>…at least to me! Well, both are pretty cool but I’ll let you guys decide if the horizontal or vertical perspective does more justice. Anyway, amidst doing these shots….we also realized an actual train was approaching in the distance! Hah. I guess trains are meant to travel on tracks but I just didn’t expect one to interrupt our program. Anyway, Ms. Stealth had already donned some fabric for some other ideas we had…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-109-_____________/blogtuc2a/" rel="attachment wp-att-1971"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1971 colorbox-1966" alt="blogTuc2a" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2a.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2a.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/blogTuc2a-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>…..but quickly had to cover up as our loud visitor approached! So, she threw her hippy dress back on and we climbed away from the tracks so the train could pass. But, as he got close&#8230;and saw us standing there….he stopped. Literally. Just slowed the train down and came to a halt. Hmmm…I wondered if we were trespassing or doing something illegal….LOL….but the guy never even got out of the train! He just sat there and watched:</p>

<p>Well, we weren’t quite sure what to do…. but after a while just figured he was simply stopped there to appreciate Stealth’s beauty and the unique situation he sort of stumbled on. So, we continued shooting a few more images of her dancing with the train in the background…and hope he enjoyed the show.</p>
<p>Do you wonder why he might have stopped to check out Ms. Stealth?</p>
<p>Perhaps her smile??</p>
<p>Or…..maybe….could it have been because of:</p>

<p>Woo Hooo. Life on the Lonely …….tracks!</p>
<p>We finally left and started rolling back to town…. and came across one last area that drew both of our attention. It was right off Interstate 8, south of Tucson, AZ, and they’d been building some new homes when the economy must’ve suddenly tanked. Anyway, the framed construction reminded me of some image from the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression when the homes were abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair. So, Ms. Stealth again shed her clothing and posed in one of them….and adore the shot. Like the “Little House on the Prarie”. The wind is blowing; The tumbleweed and desert landscaping next to the structure just make you think you’re in the middle of nowhere. But, in reality, you’re just off the highway. Anyway, with her glorious frame decorating the shot..I think it’s gorgeous and full of contrast:</p>

<p>Well ….that’s all for now. Thanks for sharing in Ms. Stealth’s day on the Lonely!</p>

			<p>Hi, again, loyal Lonely Road Blog followers, friends and those who may be visiting me for the first time. So, in my last entry I tried to whittle down a specific shoot of mine and focus on a narrow portion of it. Sort of tell a story about a certain portion of that photoshoot. Anyway, I hope you liked it. Because, OH YEAH, I may have an even better story to share with you here today …as…. wait till you see and hear what happened to Kristen during her Lonely experience!!</p>
<p>So, Kristen and I met in NM, outside of Albuquerque, on a chilly and dreary day back in 2010! We drove up to the Ojito Wilderness, about 50 miles outside the city, near these famous White Mesas that you can see when you hike or ride up the Sandia Peaks. It’s an awesome area, which I’ve used previously for several of my shoots, and which I’m sure I’ll use again someday when I return. Odd rock formations, long and dusty stretches of winding roads, bizarre and abandoned buildings….some really neat stuff. Anyway, she also braved some cold conditions that day as it was only about 45 degrees!! Yeah, a total trooper!</p>
<p>Well….Kristen had never been naked in public before and I told her we’d probably expect some bikers, hikers or ranchers along those roads at different times. I asked her if she feared being caught in a state of undress. Her reply was mostly laughs and the attitude that she was game for anything! So, that’s when her challenges began. For, it was my suggestion that she wear some skimpy black bow tie top and another strap of snap-material for a bottom and just stand there along one of the main roads, contrasted to nature. Hmmm…..and thus her fun began!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1935"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1935 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT1" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT1.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT1.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>This first picture you see shows Kristen twisting around to look at me, not totally<br />
confident, with the snap-material raised up over her butt. I think it looked<br />
great from behind, but, you can see she’s not liking the idea that somebody<br />
could approach from the front and see a LOT of her! Hah. So, in the second shot<br />
we tried a slightly different angle, while she held a cigarette to calm her<br />
nerves, still with the snap-material in the same position:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1936"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1936 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT2" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT2.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT2.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it was dramatic and sexy…but, again, that was asking a lot of her and probably way too much “going on” for any car approaching from her front. But, from the back… with her awesome booty…I loved the look…though I admit it’s probably too sexy. Anyway, she opted to try using the snap-material wedged down in the back instead, exposing her ass, but still offering coverage where she needed it most:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1937"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT3" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT3.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT3.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT3-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>OMG…right away a car is coming and I captured a low-angle perspective focused on that vehicle as it approached…through her legs. Check out her hands! Hah..she’s totally<br />
uncomfortable and doubting the whole experience. And, LOL, how about the image<br />
after that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt4/" rel="attachment wp-att-1938"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1938 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT4" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT4.jpg" width="440" height="616" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT4.jpg 440w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT4-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></p>
<p>The people were totally smiling as they want past me but Kristen is waving awkwardly and still completely unsure of herself as she knows these random “passers-by” are seeing her in a pretty damn revealed and risqué situation! And, though they can’t “see anything” just yet…since her boobs and front are covered….Kristen knows they’re about to see her bare ass as they pass by! Hah…..adrenaline rush for all 3 of the people involved.</p>
<p>Now I have to ask a question: Can you do it? Do you have what it takes to be a Lonely Road Model? J</p>
<p>Well….Kristen sure did. As soon as they passed, freezing her lovely bare bottom off….she ran back to me and put on her pants. Grabbed a snack and started giggling about the whole experience while nibbling on some food. She’d loved it, despite the nervousness and concern….and was totally gaining confidence. And, when I showed her some of the pictures on the camera she just howled out load!! Pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt5/" rel="attachment wp-att-1939"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1939 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT5" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT5.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT5.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT5-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>The next test was to suggest NO BOTTOMS at all. Yeah. Now, that was still a bit premature for her since standing fully nude from the waist down while strangers pass by is a bit hard to swallow. So, she felt just holding onto that snap-material would be OK. At least, she felt, she could hold that material in front of her should the car approaching contain someone that made her squeamish.  And, I’ve got to tell you, my goal was to actually have cars come from the rear and only see her butt….as I’m not trying to freak anyone out or embarrass my models. So, I didn’t blame her for keeping her safety measure in hand. And….you’ll see that in this next shot….a shot I just love…. her long/statuesque figure and that amazing booty of hers looks just divine with the material next to her:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt6/" rel="attachment wp-att-1940"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1940 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT6" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT6.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT6.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT6-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>The next shot is a close-up of Kristen’s stunning face! Man, she’s blessed with gorgeous features and now you can imagine how happy some of those drivers must’ve been as they pulled up and saw this woman. Jeez…she’s striking, and I just adore those lips and eyes of hers. And, that bow tie top is so fun and cute. I can only imagine what the drivers of that first grey truck must have been thinking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt7/" rel="attachment wp-att-1941"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1941 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT7" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT7.jpg" width="400" height="600" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT7.jpg 400w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT7-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>OK…after that you’ll see another shot of her turned towards me still holding the material next to her side. And, she’s a bit apprehensive since I’m again suggesting she LOSE the material completely again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt8/" rel="attachment wp-att-1942"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT8" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT8.jpg" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT8.jpg 600w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT8-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT8-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Hah, persistence is the key…as long as I’m building up her confidence while we go and insuring she’s having fun and not getting too cold!! Well…as you might guess….I finally did get her to try that. And, the key was that we were in a position on a road that offered us pretty good views of what was coming from both directions. Also, I agreed to let her change shoes and put on something that allowed her to move more quickly…as she wanted to be able to run and hide if she lost her guts!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, we soon realized a couple cars were approaching us from the rear…from a ways off!  This would allow me to position her bottom towards them, stand off to the side of the road, and capture them passing her while also affording them a view of her epic bare ass! Ooooh, yeah, a nice treat for anyone in the Ojito that day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/lonely-roads-108-kristen-in-the-ojito-feb-20-2010/blogkt9/" rel="attachment wp-att-1943"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1943 colorbox-1932" alt="blogKT9" src="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT9.jpg" width="430" height="602" srcset="http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT9.jpg 430w, http://www.mgimageryphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blogKT9-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>And, whataya think of the picture? She’s bottomless, waving at the cars that have passed, comprised of mountain bikers that had been out riding the trails all day. FYI…both cars honked and waived, and Kristen gave them a gift they’ll forever remember.</p>
<p>The Lonely Road. Wooo Hoooo.</p>
<p>Well…my last image to share is Kristen celebrating life as we finished our day. She’s put a few pieces of clothing back on, is jumping for joy, and is laughing about the art we created and the people we touched!</p>
